Develop "Mini Trello/Kanban" interface - With Drag & Drop of cards between columns, Add / Remove / Update Card
Frontend: React / Hooks + Tailwind css (or equivalent) / Apollo Client GraphQL (no redux preferably)
Backend: Python / Graphene DB: DynamoDB Local
Notes:
- The Trello/Kanban like interface must be implemented from scratch not re-using a fully featured Kanban board package.
- However the drag and drop functionality can leverage a react library
- An option to order the cards by date of creation or by custom
Bonus: Package / Run App in Docker container and/or AWS
Step 1:
- Delivery of code on Github
- Record and send short 10m Loom video to demo the UI/functionality, code overview (show browser network tab with graphql queries/mutations)
Step 2:
- Interview to discuss the code / implementation with Algo question (efficient reordering of cards)
